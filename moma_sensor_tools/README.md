# moma_sensor_tools

Collection of utilities related to sensor used in the moma demos.


Currently this package contains utilities to use and calibration of the _rokubimini_ force torque sensor.
Calibration is performed sending the robot to various target poses and estimating, assuming that the wrench is only generated by the payload, its properties (COM, weights and biases).

## Wrench filtering and plotting

To show a plot of the raw and filtered wrench applied at the end effector, follow these steps:
- Launch a franka state controller on the real robot (for example `roslaunch moma_robot robot_pc.launch`)
- Run the wrench filtering: `roslaunch moma_sensor_tools ft_sensor_standalone.launch`
  - Accept to start to previous streaming plugin
  - Select the topics `/franka_state_controller/F_ext` and `/ft_compensated`
- Show plots of the wrench in plotjuggler on the operator PC: `roslaunch moma_robot operator_pc.launch plot:=true`
